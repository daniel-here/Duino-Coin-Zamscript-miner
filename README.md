# Basic ZamScript syntax
`write` is a function for displaying text in the console.

`{` and `}` are default brackets for functions and stuff like that.

`getall [module]` is for importing all functions in a module.

`get [module]` is for importing the module.

`define [function_name]{inputs}` are for defining functions.

Since this languages syntax format and modules are all Python based, `!pip install [package]` installs the package with `pip`.

`if [statement] then` is for making an if-then statement.

`is = to` and `is not = to` are for making statements about if two things are equal or not.

`otherwise if` and `otherwise then` are for else and else if (elif) statements.

`//` are for comments.

`forever` is a infinitly repeating loop.

`type` is for making classes.

`sh [command]` is for running shell commands.

`mod` is for taking mods between numbers.

`<<<` and `>>>` are brackets for making dictionaries.

`repeat [number_of_times_to_repeat]` is for repeating that code that many times (without the square brackets).

That rest is like Python except for the fact that it supports Cython syntax like `cdef [type] [variable_name]`.
